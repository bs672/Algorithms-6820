\section*{Problem 4}

We will describe a reduction from \tc to \tr. For this reduction we
will define gadgets for every vertex and edge in the input \tc graph
$G$, by creating one tree for every vertex and one tree for every
edge, which are described by Figure \ref{q4:vertextree}
and Figure \ref{q4:edgetree}.
In addition we will create a single scaffolding tree, which is
described by Figure \ref{q4:scafftree}. Finally, in this
reduction we will set the value of $m$ to be $H + 4n + 1$,
where $n$ is the number vertices in $G$, and $H$ corresponds
to the constant appearing in the tree gadgets, which is assumed
to be very large (greater than $4n + 1$).

In order to prove that this reduction is correct, we need to argue
that a graph $G$ is 3-colorable if and only if there is a tree
$T$ with at most $m$ vertices that has all the gadget trees
as subtrees. 

For the forward direction, suppose $G$ is 3-colorable. We will
describe how to create a tree $T$ of size $m$ with all the gadget
trees as subtrees. First we initialize $T$ as the scaffolding
tree $T_S$, and we arbitrarily label the colors in a 3-coloring
of $G$ as $R$, $G$, and $B$. Now we will extend this tree
by adding a new node for every vertex $v_i$. Suppose the color
of $v_i$ is $C$: we will create a new node $c_i$ and
add an edge from node $v_i^C$ to $c_i$.

Now we argue that this $T$ has the desired properties.
First of all, $T_S$ had $H + 3n + 1$ nodes, and we 
added $n$ nodes to it to construct $T$, so clearly $T$
has exactly $m$ vertices.
Secondly, for each vertex $v_i$ in $G$ we attached a new node to
either $v_i^R$, $v_i^G$, or $v_i^B$ in $T_S$. Refer to the ``hat''
of the tree as node $R$ along with the $h_j$ nodes. Then
the subtree of $T$ corresponding to the hat, $c_i$, and
the $v$ nodes in the branch of the tree corresponding
ot the color of $v_i$ is isomorphic to the vertex gadget
of $v_i$. Thirdly, for every edge $(v_i, v_j)$ we know
that $v_i$ and $v_j$ have different colors in $G$, so
the $c_i$ and $c_j$ nodes must have been added in different
branches of $G$. Thus the subtree given by the hat, $c_i$,
$c_j$, and the $v$ nodes in the two branches corresponding to
the colors of $v_i$ and $v_j$ is isomorphic to the corresponding
edge gadget. Finally $T$ was constructed by extending $T_S$,
so $T_S$ is a subtree. Thus we have proved the forward
direction.

For the backwards direction of the proof, suppose we can
construct a tree $T$ with at most $m$ vertices containing
$T_S$ along with all the vertex and edge gadgets based on
$G$ as subtrees. We will argue from this that $G$ is 3-colorable.
First of all, given $T_S$ is a subtree $T$ must have at least
$H + 3n + 1$ vertices, so it can have at most $n$ vertices
in addition to the vertices in the subtree isomorphic to $T_S$.
Now we will consider the possible ways that $T_S$ could be
extended to $T$ in order to incorporate the vertex and
edge gadgets. Since $H$ is so large, the hats of the gadget
subtrees must be the same as the hat of $T_S$ (else we would
have to add too many vertices).
Each vertex gadget $v_i$ requires
a path of length $n$ rooted at $R$, with an extra vertex
attached to the $i$'th node in the path. Obviously the
only way to satisfy this for all $n$ gadgets given we can
only add $n$ extra nodes,
would be to attach exactly one new node to one
of the three $v_i^{color}$ vertices for each
$i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$. Therefore we can conclude that $T$
must be isomorphic to $T_S$ with this kind of extension.

Given we know roughly the structure that $T$ must have,
we will argue how to 3-color $G$ based on $T$. First
locate the vertex of maximum degree and label it as $R$,
and label its leaf neighbours as $\{h_1,\ldots,h_H\}$
arbitrarily. Then arbitrarily label the three branches
corresponding to the remaining three children of as $R$,
$G$, and $B$, and label the depth $i$ non-leaf nodes
in each branch as $v_i^R$, $v_i^G$, and $v_i^B$
respectively. Given what we have reasoned about
the structure of $T$ this is possible to do, and for
each $i$ exactly one of $v_i^R$, $v_i^G$, or $v_i^B$
will have three neighbors. We color $v_i$ in $G$
with the label of the branch where the $v_i$ node
has three neighbors.

Finally, we will argue that this
satisfies the constraint that neighboring vertices
in $G$ must have different colors.
