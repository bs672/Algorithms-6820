\section*{Problem 2}

To prove that MOST NON-NEGATIVE SOLUTION is in NP, we need to provide the recipe for a polynomially-sized certificate which can be verified in polynomial time. The certificate is just a set $K$ of $k$ variables which will take non-negative values. Note that the size of the problem in bits is $\text{poly}(n \log U)$ where $U$ is the largest integer (in absolute value) in $A$ or $b$. To verify the certificate we need to verify that there is some $x$ where 

\begin{align*}
Ax &= b\\
x_i &\geq b \quad \forall i \in K
\end{align*}

which can be done in polynomial time of the input size using the ellipsoid algorithm.
