\section*{Problem 1}

In order to address this problem we will introduce a new directed graph $G^*$,
which contains all the vertices in $G$ as well as an additional source vertex $s$
and sink vertex $t$. For every edge $(u, v)$ in $G$ we introduce two directed
edges in $G^*$; one from $u$ to $v$ and one from $v$ to $u$. In addition we
introduce an edge from $s$ to every vertex from $V(G)$, and an edge from every
vertex from $V(G)$ to $t$. Finally we define capacities on these edges
as follows:

\[
c(u, v) =
    \begin{cases}
        m &\quad \text{if}\ u = s \\
        m + 2d - deg(u) &\quad \text{if}\ v = t \\
        1 &\quad \text{otherwise} \\
    \end{cases}
\]

Now, consider an arbitrary cut $(S, T)$ of the directed graph $G^*$. We will use the shorthand
$S' = S \setminus \{s\}$, and $T' = T \setminus \{t\}$, $V' = S' \cup T'$, and
$E' = \{(u, v) \mid (u, v) \in E(G^*),\ u \neq s,\ v \neq t\}$.
Furthermore, for every vertex $u \in V'$ we will define $k_{S'}(u)$, $k_{T'}(u)$, and $k_{V'}(u)$
to be the number of vertices in $S'$, $T'$, and $V'$ respectively that $u$ has a directed
edge to. Note that obviously for every vertex $k_{S'}(u) + k_{T'}(u) = k_{V'}(u)$.
The capacity of the cut is as follows:

\begin{align*}
  c(S, T) &= \sum_{u \in S'}{c(u, t)} + \sum_{v \in T'}{c(s, v)} + \sum_{u \in S',\ v \in T',\ (u, v) \in E'}{c(u, v)} \\
          &= \sum_{u \in S'}{(m + 2d - k_{V'}(u))} + \sum_{v \in T'}{m} + \sum_{u \in S',\ v \in T',\ (u, v) \in E'}{1} \\
          &= |S'|(m + 2d) - \sum_{u \in S'}{k_{V'}(u)} + |T'|m + \sum_{u \in S'}{k_{T'}(u)} \\
          &= |V'|m + 2|S'|d - \sum_{u \in S'}{k_{S'}(u)} \\
          &= |V'|m + 2|S'|d - 2|S'|D(S') \\ 
          &= |V'|m + 2|S'|(d - D(S')) \\ 
\end{align*}
where $m$ refers to the number of edges in the original graph $G$, and
$D(S')$ refers to the average degree of the vertices in the subgraph of $G$
defined by taking the vertices in $S'$, and all edges with both endpoints in $S'$.

Since $|V'|m$ is a constant for all cuts, the cut capacity will be minimized when
$|S'|(d - D(S'))$ is minimized. Furthermore, it is clear that the value of the cut
is less than $|V'|m$ if and only if the subgraph of $G$ defined by $S'$ has
average degree greater than $d$.

This gives a natural algorithm for finding a dense subgraph: run any max flow algorithm
on $G^*$ to calculate a maximum flow, and then compute a corresponding minimum
cut $c(S, T)$. If the value of the max flow / min cut is less than $|V'|m$ then $S'$ defines
a subgraph of $G$ with average degree greater than $d$. Otherwise no such dense subgraph
exists, because if there was one then it would give a smaller cut.

To analyze the running time of the algorithm, we need to specify the procedure used to
calculate the maximum flow and a corresponding minimum cut. For maximum flow calculation
we can use Dinitz's algorithm, which has a running time of $O(mn^2)$. For calculating
a minimum cut given this maximum flow, we calculate the residual graph $G^*_f$ using the
maximum flow $f$, and calculate the set $S'$ of all vertices reachable from $s$ in $G^*_f$.
As proven in lectures in the derivation of the max-flow min-cut theorem, this defines
a minimum cut. Calculating reachability can trivially be computed in $O(m + n)$. Therefore
the overall running time of our algorithm is polynomial.

\section*{Problem 2}

\subsection*{2a}
We can maintain an invariant that $c'$ (refering to the variable
in Dinitz's algorithm) is always $0-1$. The fact of this
invariant also preserves the $0-1$ property for $G_f$, because $\delta(P) = 1$,
that is, the update step can only take an edge, delete it, and add in its
reversal to the graph with capacity $1$. Conversely, $\delta(P)$ being $1$ also
maintains the $c' \in \{0,1\}$ invariant for the same reason.

\subsection*{2b}

In the entire run of the blocking flow algortihm, the block of code that
augments $h$ using $P$ does at most $O(1)$ work per edge in the graph because
the entire path $P$ is deleted from $G'$. Each push onto the stack corresponds
to an edge and only a single time per edge. Each edge is deleted at most once
during the popping phase, and each vertex is deleted at most once.
Initialization is $O(m)$ for the reasons given in the notes. So, the total time
is $O(m+n) = O(m)$.

\subsection*{2c}

\begin{lemma} Let $G$ be a graph with $0-1$ capacities and $f$ a flow in $G$
such that $G_f$ is $0-1$. Let $f^*$ be a maximum, integral flow. Let $k=|f^*| -
|f|$.  Then $f^*-f$ has an $s$-$t$ path of length at most
$m/k$. \end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Consider the augmenting flow $f^* - f$, which has value $k$. Since $f$ is
integral and there is an integral max flow, $f*-f$ is integral. Since $G'$ is
$0-1$, we have that $f^* - f$ has $k$ saturated edges out of $s$. Considering
$f^* - f$ as a sum of paths and cycles, we see that it can be decomposed
as $k$ paths prefixed by these $k$ saturated edges each with a flow of $1$
(plus possibly some cycles). Since $G'$
has maximum (residual) capacity $1$, no edge appears in two of these paths.
Therefore at least one of these paths must have no more than $m/k$ edges, or
else the union of the paths would have more than $m$ edges, giving a
contradiction.
\end{proof}

After the first $\sqrt{m}$ phases of Dinitz, the shortest augmenting path has length
$d(t) \geq \sqrt{m}$. This implies that $|f^*| - |f| \geq \sqrt{m}$, by the
contrapositive of the above lemma. Each
additional iteration increases the flow by at least 1, so there are at most
$\sqrt{m}$ more phases go to. Thus there are at most $2\sqrt{m}$ phases,
so number of phases is $O(\sqrt{m})$

\subsection*{2d}

Define $d(i)$ as the distance from $s$ to $i$ in $G_f$ and $D_j = \{v_i: d(i) = j \}$. 
\begin{lemma} Let $G$ be a graph with $0-1$ capacities, $f$ a flow in $G$ such that 
$G_f$ is $0-1$ and $d_t$ the distance from $s$ to $t$ in $G_f$. Only less than half 
of $\{D_i\}$ can have more than $2\cdot \frac{n}{d_t}$ vertices.\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By the end of each iteration, the cardinality of $\{D_i\}$ is always $d(t)$. 
If there are half or more $D_i$'s that has more than $2\frac{n}{d(t)}$ vertices, 
then $$\text{Total Vertices} \geq (2\frac{n}{d(t)} + 1) * \frac{1}{2} d(t) 
= n + \frac{1}{2} d(t) > n$$ which is a contradiction. 
\end{proof}

Suppose that Dinitz has run for $2n^{2/3}$ iterations; at this point the 
shortest path to $t$ has length $d(t)\geq 2n^{2/3}$. 
Given the above lemma, over half of the $\{D_i\}$ have fewer than
$n^{1/3}$ vertices, so it must be the case that there are two consecutive sets
($D_j$ and $D_{j+1}$) that have less than $n^{1/3}$ vertices each.
Clearly the number of edges crossing from $D_j$ to $D_{j+1}$ is less than $(n^{1/3})^2 = n^{2/3}$.
This defines an upper-bound on the min-cut of $G_f$, meaning that the flow
can be increased by at most $n^{2/3}$ at this point, so 
the algorithm can run at most another $n^{2/3}$ iterations. Thus the number
of phases is $O(n^{2/3})$.

\section*{Problem 3}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{Find All Unreachable Nodes}{$G$}
\State Initialize $C = \{\}$
\While{$|C| < k$}
\State Find an $s$-$t$ path $P$ in $G$ using BFS
\State Find first unreachable node in $P$ using binary search with PING calls
\State Let $v$ be first unreachable node, $u$ be the previous node in $P$
\State Add $(u,v)$ to $C$
\State Delete edge $(u,v)$ from $G$
\EndWhile
\State Run BFS on $G$ starting from $s$ to find all reachable nodes
\State Let $R$ be set of reachable nodes from previous step
\State \Return $V(G) \setminus R$
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

To clarify step 5 of the algorithm,
we maintain a range of possible indices in $P$ where the first
unreachable node could be located (initially all of $P$), and in each iteration
of the binary search PING the node in the center (call this node $u_c$). If $u_c$
is unreachable then the first unreachable node must be located in the first half
of $P$ (including $u_c$), else it is in the second half of $P$ (not including $u_c$).
This means we can cut the search space in half in each iteration of binary search
with a single call to PING.

We will argue the invariant that $C$ grows by one each iteration, and that it
is a subset of the attacker's cut. Whenever $|C| < k$, $C$ does not cut $s$
from $t$: This is because of the min-cut max-flow theorem: since we know that
the max flow is $k$, the size of the min cut must also be $k$. Hence when $|C| <
k$, there is an $s-t$ path, so the BFS will succeed. It's clear that $(u, v)$
was in the attacker's cut, because otherwise $v$ would be reachable since
$u$ is reachable, $(u, v) \in E$, and removing edges cannot make any previously
unreachable nodes reachable. Therefore the loop body maintains the invariant.

Now, let's count the number of PING$(v)$ calls.  There are only k iterations of
the while loop.  In each iteration we use PING$(v)$ $O(\log n)$ times, because we
are using it in a binary search manner on a path of nodes with maximum length
$n$. So this gives us a total of $O(k \log n)$ pings.

When the while loop terminates, $|C| = k$ and $C$ is a subset of the attacker's
cut edges, so $C$ must be equal to the attacker's cut. Hence, when we run BFS
in step 10, we find all the reachable nodes. The complement of this is the
unreachable nodes.
