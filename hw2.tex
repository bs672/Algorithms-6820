\section{Problem 1}

In order to address this problem we will introduce a new directed graph $G^*$,
which contains all the vertices in $G$ as well as an additional source vertex $s$
and sink vertex $t$. For every edge $(u, v)$ in $G$ we introduce two directed
edges in $G^*$; one from $u$ to $v$ and one from $v$ to $u$. In addition we
introduce an edge from $s$ to every vertex from $V(G)$, and an edge from every
vertex from $V(G)$ to $t$. Finally we define capacities on these edges
as follows:

\[
c(u, v) =
    \begin{cases}
        m &\quad \text{if}\ u = s \\
        m + 2d - deg(u) &\quad \text{if}\ v = t \\
        1 &\quad \text{otherwise} \\
    \end{cases}
\]

Now, consider an arbitrary cut $(S, T)$ of the directed graph $G^*$. We will use the shorthand
$S' = S \setminus \{s\}$, and $T' = T \setminus \{t\}$, $V' = S' \cup T'$, and
$E' = \{(u, v) \mid (u, v) \in E(G^*),\ u \neq s,\ v \neq t\}$.
Furthermore, for every vertex $u \in V'$ we will define $k_{S'}(u)$, $k_{T'}(u)$, and $k_{V'}(u)$
to be the number of vertices in $S'$, $T'$, and $V'$ respectively that $u$ has a directed
edge to.  The capacity of the cut is as follows:

\begin{align*}
  c(S, T) &= \sum_{u \in S'}{c(u, t)} + \sum_{v \in T'}{c(s, v)} + \sum_{u \in S',\ v \in T',\ (u, v) \in E'}{c(u, v)} \\
          &= \sum_{u \in S'}{m + 2d - k_{V'}(u)} + \sum_{v \in T'}{m} + \sum_{u \in S',\ v \in T',\ (u, v) \in E'}{1} \\
          &= |S'|(m + 2d) - \sum_{u \in S'}{k_{V'}(u)} + |T'|m + \sum_{u \in S'}{k_{T'}(u)} \\
          &= |V'|m + 2|S'|d - \sum_{u \in S'}{k_{S'}(u)} \\
          &= |V'|m + 2|S'|d - 2|S'|D(S') \\ 
          &= |V'|m + 2|S'|(d - D(S')) \\ 
\end{align*}
where $D(S')$ refers to the average degree of the vertices in the subgraph defined by
the vertices in $S'$.

Since $|V'|m$ is a constant for all cuts, the cut capacity will be minimized when
$|S'|(d - D(S'))$ is minimized. This gives a natural algorithm for finding a dense subgraph:
run any max flow algorithm on $G^*$, and compute a corresponding minimum
cut $c(S, T)$. If the value of the maximum flow is less than $|V'|m$ then $S'$ defines
a subgraph of $G$ with average degree greater than $d$. Otherwise no such dense subgraph
exists, because if there was one then it would give a smaller cut.

TODO: maybe say something about computing a minimum cut?
