\begin{problem}[1]
The half-graph is a bipartite graph with vertex sets $L_0 = \{u_1,\ldots,u_n\}$ and $R_0 = \{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$ and edge set $E = \{(u_i, v_j) | i \leq j\}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that the half-graph has a unique perfect matching.
\item Let $G = (L,R,E)$ be a bipartite graph with $|L| = |R| = n$. Suppose $G$ has a unique perfect matching. Prove that $G$ is isomorphic to a subgraph of the half-graph. Your proof should be polynomial-time constructive.
\item If $\pi$ is a permutation of ${1,\ldots,n},$, let $H_\pi$ denote the "permuted half graph" with vertex sets $L_0$ and $R_0$ as in part (a) and with edge set $E_\pi = \{(u_i, v_{\pi(j)} | i \leq j\}$. If ALG is any algorithm for the online matching problem -- potentially randomized -- let $M_\pi$ denote the (potentially random) matching that results from running ALG on the input instance $H_\pi$ with the vertices of $L_0$ arriving in the order $u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n$. Prove that the expected cardinality of $M_\pi$ is at most $(1-\frac{1}{e} + o(1))n$, where the $o(1)$ term tends to zero as $n\rightarrow \infty$.
